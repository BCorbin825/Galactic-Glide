// Description: GalacticGlide.pde is the central component of the "Galactic Glide"
//              game, as it contains all the code necessary to run the 
//              game. It acts as a bridge between the user interface and 
//              the game logic, and handles various tasks such as initializing 
//              the game world, loading game assets, and managing game events.
